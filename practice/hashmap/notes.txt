Hashmap: dictionary in python. Refers to a data structure that stores information called values and pairs them up with unique identifiers called keys.

Benefits:
1. Custom keys are easier for software engineers to work with
2. Search in O(1) time complexity

Any key in hashmap must always be immutable.
